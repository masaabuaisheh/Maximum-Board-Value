# Maximum-Board-Value
The combination of Dynamic Programming and Divide & Conquer techniques offers an efficient solution to the Maximum Board Value problem. While the dynamic programming approach provides a bottom-up solution by filling a table with optimal subproblem solutions, the divide & conquer approach recursively explores all possible paths to determine the maximum sum path. Both approaches leverage the properties of optimal substructures and overlapping subproblems inherent in the problem, resulting in an efficient and scalable solution.
